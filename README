Import Dekpoke
==============

This is the data import software repository via PokeApi REST services (https://pokeapi.co),
totally developed in .NET 7 and written with C# language.
It is a console application that retrieves two input data from the user and through HTTP calls retrieves the necessary data and composes a JSON,
which is saved in the folder previously specified by the user.
